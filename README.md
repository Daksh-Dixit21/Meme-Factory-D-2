## üö¶ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or Yarn, or pnpm) installed on your system.

* **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meme-factory-d2.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meme-factory-d2.git)
    cd meme-factory-d2
    ```
    *(**Note:** Replace `YOUR_USERNAME/meme-factory-d2` with your actual GitHub repository URL after you push your code.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

### Running the application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to the address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## üì¶ Deployment

This project is a static site (client-side React application). It can be easily deployed to various static hosting providers.

### Build for Production

First, generate the production-ready build files:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
````

This command will create a `dist` folder in your project root, containing all the optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files ready for deployment.

### Recommended Deployment Platforms

  * **Vercel (Highly Recommended):**
      * Connect your Git repository to Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect it as a Vite project and configure the build command (`npm run build`) and output directory (`dist`).
      * Every push to your main branch will trigger an automatic deployment.
  * **Netlify:**
      * Similar to Vercel, connect your Git repository. Netlify will auto-detect Vite and set up the build.
  * **GitHub Pages:**
      * Requires configuring the `base` option in `vite.config.js` if deploying to a subpath.
      * You can use the `gh-pages` package to automate deployment.
